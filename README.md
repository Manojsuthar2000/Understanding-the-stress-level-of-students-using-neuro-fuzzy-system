# Understanding-the-stress-level-of-students-using-neuro-fuzzy-system
ma'am I made this project on JUPYTER NOTEBOOK 
To run it plz follow this steps:
1. upload Student Stress Level using ANFIS (1).ipynb on JUPYTER NOTEBOOK
2. copy paste whole anfis folder at this location:-
   C:\Users\Mahipal\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\
   In site-packages folder, if u already have anfis their plz replace it with this one
   
by uploading in colab.research.google.com , you will be able to open it but you will not be able to run it 
Because the changes that i did are different from what you told in lecture.
